4. `oddCaps()` - capitalizes all odd characters (first character is indexed at 0), if it is a letter
5. `evenCaps()` - capitalizes all even characters (first character is indexed at 0), if it is a letter
6. `removeExtraSpaces()` - trims the spacing at the start and end of a string and removes extra spacing between words
7. `kabobCase()` - makes all characters lowercase, removes all spacing, and inserts a hyphen between each word
